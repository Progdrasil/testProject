# COMP6551 study group

each worksheet has its own folder, you can create files inside that folder.
In general its better to write in a textual format rather than upload binary filed (pdf, png, ect.)
Github supports 3 main styles of textual formats, [Markdown], [Asciidoc] and [Restructured Text].
Asciidoc is the only dialect on github that support mathematical notations.
